# About
Hello, I’m David Rodriguez!

I’m currently a third-year student at Brooklyn College, pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science. My academic journey is complemented by my active participation in the 10th cohort of CUNY Tech Prep, where I’m honing my skills and deepening my understanding of the tech industry, along with this I was a mentee in the Brooklyn College BLMI Mentor Collective.

I’m driven by a passion for innovation and a keen interest in exploring new opportunities. I thrive on participating in diverse projects and learning from different experiences. Recently, I had the pleasure of contributing to two short podcasts, where in one I discussed topics that revolved around recent events in nerd culture.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I’ve been working on and learn more about my journey. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new possibilities!
